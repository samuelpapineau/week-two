# Introduction 

## Resonances

As I started looking for cemeteries, I knew I wanted to find some older graves. I know that the older the grave, the less chance you have of disturbing someone else because you won't be interacting with an active grave site. This of course, is not always true. Some families maintain the graves of their ancestors for hundreds of years after their deaths. Though, sometimes, those grounds are ignored or abandoned, and graves become overgrown and damaged. It was my goal to look for one of these sites which have become out of active use, and I wanted to document older gravestones.

On google earth, I discovered a cemetery in Chelsea named the Old Chelsea Protestant Cemetery. It was an older cemetery which had gone out of use, and the owner had sold the land to Gatineau Park. This cemetery was now a protected historical site, and seemed to be everything I was looking for, so I pulled up the satellite image...

 *Uh oh, this won't be easy...*

 After probably too much time trying to perfect the map, I came up with this:

 This map is almost definitely inaccurate, and I very much wanted to head out to the cemetery to see what I missed. Well, it rained on Thursday, Friday, and I had work on Saturday, so Sunday it was! 
 
 Upon arriving, I saw that at the entrance, there was a large sign decribing the history of the cemetery, and there were also booklets filled with information and quizzes on the people buried there. It was like archaeological christmas. I also got very lucky, because inside this small booklet, there was a map of the entire cemetery, with names and numbered graves.

*This map is upside down compared to mine, but I think I did a pretty good job with what I had!*
 
 
 I noticed that the cemetery was quite small. There were many stones, all spread out, and many were surrounded by decorative fences. Almost all the grave stones belonged to individuals and couples who had died in the 1800's, though some stones at the southern end of the cemetery (which I missed due to them being under trees) were more recent, dating to the 1970's. 
 
 I then followed a trail leading down a hill, and I was curious to see if the cemetery continued

*A path beside the stream, going up to the cemetery*
 <br>
 At the base of this hill was a beautiful stream making its way through the forest canopy. The immense beauty of this place, especially since it is tucked away behind a couple of restaurants and a cemetery, shocked me.

*A peaceful stream down a hill from the cemetery, who wouldn't want to be buried here?*
<br>
 It suddenly made sense to me why someone would want to be buried there. Heck, I wouldn't mind being buried there. The location itself is quiet and peaceful, and had a strong sense of natural beauty. Even back up the hill, on the ground around the stones, grew mosses, wild strawberries, lilies, cedars, and wild grasses. 
 
 With this new appreciation for the area, I began collecting data.
 
 I decided on recording the Sully plot, which is marked on the map above. I recorded a total of nine graves, though one was unmarked and may have been a footstone. I entered the data into the kobotoolbox forms and saved them as drafts until I could get home and clean up some of the data. I noticed that a lot of the decorations and features on the stones were not anywhere to be found in the code sheets I brought with me, and I also found the forms limiting to what I could add. I also found that almost all the stones had 2-3 different fonts used but the forms only had one input box for the font section, I then resorted to typing the font numbers together as one large number. Things like this may have affected the final results.
 
 After spending several hours recording the graves, I then worked on taking the photos for the photogrammetry portion in Week 3. Because the gravestones were so close together, I decided to take pictures of the stones as a group, as an experiment. Unfortunately, the column at the center of the plot is much taller than me, so I'll probably run into issues when looking at the model from above.

## Response to the Prompts

One of the passages that I thought was noteworthy was in the 2018 article discussing the tours of Cupids and Ferryland, and how graves are seldom talked about for the first settlers in the 1600s.<sub>1</sub> The idea that the deceased can be forgotten for the simple reason that others are not interested in mentioning them can be dangerous when it comes to preserving and passing on information. In my case with the Old Chelsea Cemetery, the Gatineau Park purchased the land and devoted some of its resources to protecting and maintaining the site, otherwise it could have become abandoned and forgotten such as the graves of tose original settlers in Newfoundland. 

I also found another interesting passage in *Open Data as Public Archaeology: The Monumental Archive Project* where it was sait that people were not as interested in the raw data from the site, but wanted to know more about the blog posts and the stories behind these people from when they were alive.<sub>2</sub> In my annotation, I mentioned how I believe that this holds true today. Humans are not made to remember dates and names, but we are made to remember stories and events relating to certain people, even if we are simply told about them and didn't interact with them first-hand.
