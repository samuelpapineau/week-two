# what I was trying to do

After a little too much inconvenient rain,

[It's week two time!](https://github.com/samuelpapineau/week-two)


Early this week I had identified an interesting cemetery in Gatineau called the Old Chelsea Protestant Cemetery. I was looking around the gatineau area because I knew that a lot of old pioneer graveyards exist in that area, and unfortunately many are not properly maintained. Nevertheless, I created a digital map of the area based on a google earth image and I went out for a visit.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

Since I have not worked in mortuary archaeology before, I don't quite have a connection to any other research I'm doing. However for the content on the stones, I have learned about seriation before and I find it interesting how certain artifacts can change and improve over time. I will probably use this in my future.

## what I did
+ step 1  
	+ Created digital map based on satellite imagery
+ step 2
	+ Went to the cemetery and collected data about the stones using kobotoolbox forms
+ step 3
	+ Took pictures for photogrammetry portion in week 3

## challenges 

Oh boy where do I begin... I suppose as with all in life, nothing ever goes as planned. The weather really set me back in terms of my research this week, and considering this delay, I decided to do work for week 3 during this project as well to balance things, since I figured that this might end up as more of a week 2.5 instead of a week 2.

## thoughts on where to go next

The next step is definitely putting together the webmap. I'm going to see if I'm able to incorporate the map I got at the graveyard into it to add more data, and to really evaluate the efficiency of mapping using satellite imagery. I'm also really looking forward to putting together all the pictures I took of the Sully plot (because I took *a lot* of pictures), and I'm interested to see how it turns out.
